Dear DHS GPS Data User,

We are contacting you because you downloaded a previous version of the Madagascar 2008 DHS GPS data.  
The data named MDGE51FL had substantial problems with the locations of the clusters.  
This issue was resolved in the data file MDGE52FL. This correction was also included in the data file MDGE53FL.
Please use these data for any analyses and disregard the previous data file.  
We apologize for any confusion this may cause you.
