The only difference with the original folders downloaded from the dropbox, is that the folder '2008_09' was renamed as '200809' to match the given name to the 2008-09 period in the 'data.ipynb' notebook

The 200809 file was duplicated and renamed as 2008 and the copy as 2009 to cope with the data split we perfored on the period 2008/2009

For 2009, changed number in file names from 53 to 53bis to avoid conflict
